RAG EVALUATION QUESTIONS & ANSWERS
SET 1: SIMPLE/STRAIGHTFORWARD ANSWERS
Q1: When did coffee processing begin?
A1: Coffee processing began in Ethiopia over 1,000 years ago.
Q2: What is the optimal moisture content target for dried coffee beans?
A2: The optimal moisture content is 11-12 percent (or 10.5-12.5% according to quality control specifications).
Q3: How much coffee does the global coffee industry process annually?
A3: The global coffee industry processes approximately 10 million tons of coffee cherries annually.
Q4: What is the maximum defect count allowed for specialty grade coffee?
A4: Specialty grade coffee must have no more than 5 primary defects per 300 grams of green beans.
Q5: What is the water usage for the Natural (Dry) processing method?
A5: Minimal water usage.

SET 2: MULTI-PARAGRAPH/COMPLEX ANSWERS
Q6: Explain the complete washed processing method from cherry to dried bean.
A6: The washed process involves removing all fruit from the coffee bean before drying. First, the outer skin and pulp are mechanically removed using a depulping machine. The beans, still covered in mucilage, are then fermented in water tanks for 12 to 48 hours, during which enzymes and bacteria break down the mucilage. After fermentation, beans are thoroughly washed with clean water to remove remaining mucilage residue. Following washing, beans are dried on raised beds or patios until they reach 11-12 percent moisture content, which takes 7 to 14 days depending on weather conditions. This method produces coffee with exceptional clarity of flavor but requires significant amounts of clean water.
Q7: How does the natural processing method work and what flavor characteristics does it produce?
A7: Natural processing requires minimal equipment and no water. Whole coffee cherries are spread in thin layers on raised drying beds, patios, or on the ground. The cherries must be regularly turned to ensure even drying and prevent mold growth. This process takes 3 to 4 weeks depending on climate conditions, with optimal drying occurring in regions with consistent sunshine and low humidity. During the extended drying period, the coffee bean continues to absorb sugars and flavors from the surrounding fruit, resulting in a distinctly fruity and complex cup profile. The natural method produces coffees with pronounced sweetness, heavier body, and exotic fruit notes, though it carries higher risk of defects if not carefully monitored.
Q8: What are the environmental concerns and solutions related to coffee processing?
A8: The washed processing method requires significant amounts of clean water (150L per kg) and generates wastewater that must be properly managed to avoid environmental contamination. However, modern wet mills are increasingly implementing water recycling systems and eco-pulping technologies to reduce water consumption by up to 90 percent while maintaining quality standards.

SET 3: TABLE-BASED QUESTIONS
Q9: Compare the water usage and processing time between Washed and Honey processing methods.
A9: According to the table, Washed processing uses High water (150L per kg) and takes 12-48 hours, while Honey/Pulped Natural uses Medium water (50L per kg) and takes 10-15 days.
Q10: Which processing methods are commonly used in Ethiopia and what are their characteristics?
A10: Based on the table, Ethiopia commonly uses the Natural (Dry) method, which has minimal water usage, takes 21-30 days processing time, and produces a fruity, sweet, full-bodied flavor profile.
Q11: What quality checks are performed during coffee processing and what are their target specifications?
A11: According to the quality control table: Moisture Content is checked with electronic moisture meters (target: 10.5-12.5%), Bean Sorting uses visual and mechanical sorting (target: less than 5% defects), Density Grading uses gravity separation (target: screen size 15+ for specialty), and Color Sorting uses optical color sorters (target: uniform green color).
Q12: Which processing method takes the longest time and which region commonly uses it?
A12: From the table, the Natural (Dry) method takes the longest at 21-30 days and is commonly used in Ethiopia and Brazil.

SET 4: IMAGE/VISUAL-REFERENCED QUESTIONS
Q13: What are the layers of a coffee cherry from outside to inside?
A13: According to the coffee cherry cross-section image, the layers from outside to inside are: Outer Skin → Pulp → Mucilage → Parchment → Silver Skin → Green Bean.
Q14: What does the drying beds image show about the natural processing method?
A14: The drying beds image shows whole cherries drying in the sun on raised beds, which is characteristic of the natural processing method.
