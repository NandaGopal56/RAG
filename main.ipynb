      "The Aranya River originates in the eastern slopes of the Vindhya mountain range and flows through three Indian states before merging into the Bay of Bengal. For centuries, it supported agriculture, fisheries, and small riverine trade. Seasonal flooding was common but largely predictable, and local communities adapted their farming cycles accordingly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Chunk 1:\n",
      "In 2008, recurring droughts in the downstream regions triggered renewed interest in large-scale water storage and regulation. The central government commissioned a feasibility study to assess whether a multi-purpose dam could address irrigation shortages, generate hydroelectric power, and control floods.\n",
      "The project was officially named the Aranya Integrated River Management Project (AIRMP).\n",
      "2. Initial Feasibility Study (2009–2011)\n",
      "The feasibility study was led by HydroSys Consultants, a public-private consortium. Their findings concluded:\n",
      "\n",
      "Chunk 2:\n",
      "- A dam at Kundar Gorge could store up to 4.2 billion cubic meters of water.\n",
      "- Approximately 42,000 hectares of land would be submerged.\n",
      "- Around 18 villages would require partial or complete relocation.\n",
      "- The dam could generate 900 MW of electricity at peak capacity.\n",
      "\n",
      "Chunk 3:\n",
      "The report emphasized that long-term economic benefits outweighed social costs, provided rehabilitation was executed efficiently.\n",
      "However, an internal appendix—later leaked—highlighted uncertainties around sediment accumulation and underestimation of displacement numbers.\n",
      "3. Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA)\n",
      "An Environmental Impact Assessment was conducted in 2012 by GreenSphere Analytics.\n",
      "\n",
      "Chunk 4:\n",
      "Key findings included:\n",
      "- The river supported at least 12 endemic fish species.\n",
      "- Seasonal flooding played a critical role in soil nutrient replenishment.\n",
      "- The dam would alter groundwater recharge patterns within a 60 km radius.\n",
      "\n",
      "Chunk 5:\n",
      "Despite these findings, the final EIA summary concluded that impacts were manageable with standard mitigation measures.\n",
      "4. Policy Approval and Funding\n",
      "In 2013, the project received clearance from the Ministry of Water Resources, Ministry of Power, and concerned state governments.\n",
      "Funding structure:\n",

      "\n",
      "Chunk 7:\n",
      "The Resettlement & Rehabilitation Plan proposed monetary compensation, residential plots, and job preferences.\n",
      "Problems included outdated land records, exclusion of tenant farmers, and informal job promises.\n",
      "By 2016, less than 40% of affected households had received full compensation.\n",

      "Chunk 8:\n",
      "Construction began in 2014 and faced cost overruns, labor disputes, and a fatal landslide incident in 2017.\n",
      "7. Commissioning and Early Operation\n",
      "The dam became operational in 2020. Power generation reached only 62% of projected capacity, and fish populations declined by 35–40% by 2022.\n",
      "8. Socio-Economic Impact\n",
      "\n",
      "Chunk 9:\n",
      "Some displaced families benefited from improved infrastructure, while others lost livelihoods. Around 30% migrated again to urban areas.\n",
